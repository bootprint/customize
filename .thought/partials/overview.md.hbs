Customize is an abstraction of [bootprint's](https://github.com/nknapp/bootprint) the merging-behaviour. 
It allows you to create your own projects and engines (other than Less and Handlebars) and create 
overridable configurations for those.

At its core, it uses [lodash#mergeWith](https://lodash.com/docs#mergeWith) to merge configurations.
It uses a customizer-function that supports promises and custom overrider functions 
attached to the object.
